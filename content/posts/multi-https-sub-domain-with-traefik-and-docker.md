Today I'll show you how to make several Docker containers accessible via automatic HTTPS with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) on different sub domains.
I assume you are already familiar with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), if not I recommend you to read the following [getting started guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/), especially the first three parts.

## Traefik
We will use [*Traefik*](https://traefik.io). So first what is *Traefik*? According to its website: 
> Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer made to deploy microservices with ease. It supports several backends (Docker, Swarm mode, Kubernetes, Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Rancher, Amazon ECS, and a lot more) to manage its configuration automatically and dynamically.

In our case, we will principally use the reverse proxy feature, and the automatic configuration. That means the right redirection from the sub domain to the right Docker.

## Prerequisites
In order to follow this guide, you will need a server and a domain name. You can of course test Traefik on your local computer, but this is intended to real sub domains. 

So I will consider that you have already:
* a running and accessible server
* a domain name and some sub domain names all pointing to your server IP
* a working installation of Docker

## Let's dive into it
For the first example I'll just create a basic web server using nginx.
We'll create the necessary directories
```
$ mkdir -p server/{traefik,nginx}
```

In the `traefik` folder, we can now create the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:raclette
    command: --docker
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
      - "./traefik.toml:/traefik.toml"
      - "./acme.json:/acme.json"
    networks:
      - default
```

Basically what it does is:
* Pull the raclette (1.3) Traefik docker image
* Start the command with the `docker` argument, which enable the Docker backend
* Map the port HTTP and HTTPS ports to the host
* Mount the Docker sock (to communicate with the Docker daemon)
* Mount the configuration file and the Let's Encrypt file
Now we can create the `traefik.toml` and the `acme.toml`

## Let's Encrypt
Traefik uses Let's Encrypt to generate automated HTTPS certificate for free. For more technical information you can visit the [Let's Encrypt website](https://letsencrypt.org/). 

It will generate a certificate for each service we will create, and manage the renewal. The `acme.json` is here to store these certificates. We could keep it inside the Docker since if it reboots it will regenerate the certificates, however keeping it outside our container is a bit more efficient. (It could also avoid us to reach Let's Encrypt limits). 
The file needs to have only read-write permissions for the current user so let's create it and set the right permissions: 
```
$ touch acme.json && chmod 600 acme.json
```

## traefik.toml
The Traefik config file is in the toml format. Here is a short example with HTTP redirection to HTTPS and Let's Encrypt certificate:
```toml
# defaultEntryPoints must be at the top 
# because it should not be in any table below

defaultEntryPoints = ["http", "https"]

# Entrypoints, http and https
[entryPoints]

# http should be redirected to https
[entryPoints.http]
address = ":80"
[entryPoints.http.redirect]
entryPoint = "https"

# https is the default
[entryPoints.https]
address = ":443"

[entryPoints.https.tls]

# Enable ACME (Let's Encrypt): automatic SSL
[acme]
email = "your.email@domain.com"
storage = "/acme.json"
entryPoint = "https"
onDemand = false
OnHostRule = true

[docker]
endpoint = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
domain = "yourdomain.com"
watch = true
exposedbydefault = false
```

You have to change your email, and the domain name. In this case, I disabled the `exposedbydefault` so we'll have to manually tell that a container have to be exposed. 

## Run it!
Now that we have all the configuration file:
```
$ ls # in server/traefik
acme.json  docker-compose.yml traefik.toml
```

we can execute `docker-compose up -d`. 
It will create the Docker container for Traefik and a new network `traefik_default`. 
If we curl the sub domain desired for nginx we get a `404 page not found` which indicates that Traefik received the requests but did not found any backend to proxy the request. Let's set up our nginx container next!

## Our first service
We succeeded to set up Traefik, we now have to use it. In order to use the Docker backend, we will use the Docker labels. Here are a few labels:
* `traefik.backend=example` gives the name example to the generated backend
* `traefik.port=80` which indicates which port Traefik will proxy the requests to
* `traefik.enable=true` enable Traefik on the specified container
* `traefik.frontend.rule=Host:subdomain.example.com` tells Traefik to route all the requests from this sub domain to this container

The full list can be found [here](https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/backends/docker/).

Here is the `docker-compose.yml` for the simple nginx container:
```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:stable
    labels:
      - "traefik.enabled=true"
      - "traefik.backend=nginx"
      - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:subdomain.example.com"
      - "traefik.port=80"
    restart: always
    networks:
      - traefik_default
networks:
  traefik_default:
    external:
      name: traefik_default
```

We don't need the expose the port 80 since Traefik redirects the traffic in the container. And we have to add another network to have the Traefik container and the nginx container in the same network, so they can communicate. Another way would be the add the label `traefik.docker.network` with the right network name. 

Finally you just have to `docker-compose up -d` and voil√†! If you now try to open `subdomain.example.com` you will be redirected to `https://subdomain.example.com` with a valid certificate and you can see the nginx page. 

## A practical example
I'll show you a quick example with two Docker containers running [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) on `test1.ptrk.io` and `test2.ptrk.io`. We need to create a directory `test` and the following files:

* `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
version: '2'

services:
    test1:
        build: .
        labels:
          - "traefik.enabled=true"
          - "traefik.backend=test1"
          - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:test1.ptrk.io"
          - "traefik.port=5000"
        networks:
          - "traefik_default"
        restart: always
    test2:
        build: .
        labels:
          - "traefik.enabled=true"
          - "traefik.backend=test2"
          - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:test2.ptrk.io"
          - "traefik.port=5000"
        networks:
          - "traefik_default"
        restart: always
networks:
    traefik_default:
        external:
            name: traefik_default
```

* `Dockerfile`
```dockerfile
FROM python:2.7
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install flask
ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["start.py"]
```

* `start.py`
```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello " + request.host


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=False,host='0.0.0.0')
```

Now if I run `docker-compose up -d` I can check [test1.ptrk.io](https://test1.ptrk.io) and [test2.ptrk.io](https://test2.ptrk.io) to see that we are correctly redirected to the right container.

## Conclusion
You can found out more on the [Traefik docs](https://docs.traefik.io/), and in my next post I'll explain how to access to the Traefik web UI on another sub domain, and with basic HTTP authentication.
