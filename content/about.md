## Past

![Chatgpt generated picture of a mix of Paris, Grenoble and Stockholm](/images/about-1.webp)

Welcome, I'm **Patrik** (or sometimes **[Sh4d1](https://github.com/Sh4d1)**), and living in Paris!

I'm a long time Linux user (I use arch btw), that loves to build, and operates systems, especially distributed ones. 

I was born in Stockholm in 1994, grew up in the french alps,
graduated from _[Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/)_ in early 2018, where among others things, I wrote a compiler in Java, a processor in VHDL, and a kernel in C.

I'm native in french, and fluent in english, while trying to keep my swedish up to the level. 

### Scaleway

#### Kubernetes

I then moved to Paris and joined _[Scaleway](https://scaleway.com)_ as a DevOps engineer on
_[Kapsule](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kapsule/)_, the managed Kubernetes solution in early 2019.
The next 2.5 years were spent building from the ground up a Kubernetes distribution. 
I even made a *[webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTV_whRZG58)* explaining how it all works under the hood (though a lot have changed since, for the best).

It taught me a lot about building systems, Kubernetes, containers, automation, configuration management, Golang, good practices, ...

Let's say I learned a lot these first years, and I loved it!
It also started an unavoidable love/hate relationship with Kubernetes.

#### S3

The opportunity to join the object storage's Site Reliability Engineer team presented itself in fall 2021, which I took.
That brought me to spend the next 2.5 years building (in C) and running a globally distributed key/value database, _[Hive](https://papers.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/hive.pdf)_,
meant to store the metadata of all S3 object, while contribuing to _[libfloat](https://git.sr.ht/~ne02ptzero/libfloat)_,
a C raft implementation, by my colleague and friend **[Louis](https://ne02ptzero.me/)**.

On top of that, I learned a lot about bare metal environment (PXE, networking, storage, ...) with deployments of thousands of servers, across multiple regions,
while also taking ownership and scaling the monitoring stack (elasticsearch, vector, prometheus/victoriametrics, grafana).


## Present

### amo

I left Scaleway in march 2024, to join a new adventure as SRE at **[amo](https://amo.co/about)**.

The tables have turned, as I'm now on the other side of the spectrum, using a cloud provider, instead of building for one.
There are a lot of new things to learn, and to discover! To be continued...
